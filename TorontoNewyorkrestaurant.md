<h1>Toronto and New York Restaurants Comparison</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>Opening a restaurant is one of the most important financial decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. It can be a daunting experience for some. </h4>

<h4>Throughout project, I explore the in-depth process of opening a restaurant in New York and Toronto. Where the processes diverge between the two cities, I explain the differences.  It’s our goal to educate potential restaurant owner about the differences  and make it easier to understand. </h4>

<h4>New York and Toronto are two of biggest cities in North East.  New York is famously diverse city. New York City welcomed a record 65.2 million visitors, comprising 51.6 million domestic and 13.5 million international visitors, the ninth consecutive year of tourism growth. </h4>

<h4>Long recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world, Toronto has only recently started receiving the attention it deserves as a tourist destination, and there’s never been a better time to visit. Urban renewal projects have transformed industrial zones, and an energetic dining scene churns out a steady stream of innovative restaurants.</h4>
